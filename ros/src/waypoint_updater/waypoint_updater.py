'''
This node will publish waypoints from the car's current position
to some `x` distance ahead.

As mentioned in the doc, you should ideally first implement a version which
does not care about traffic lights or obstacles.

Once you have created dbw_node, you will update this node to use the status
of traffic lights too.

Please note that our simulator also provides the exact location of
traffic lights and their current status in `/vehicle/traffic_lights` message.
You can use this message to build this node as well as to
verify your TL classifier.

TODO (for Yousuf and Aaron): Stopline location for each traffic light.
